1)  LEE
[pickup1] [hushed, sharp] Cover me.
2)  LEE
[pickup1][hushed] Probably shouldn't go that way.
3)  LEE
[pickup1][hushed] That way's not safe.
4)  LEE
[pickup1][hushed] Carley, stay here.
5)  LEE
[pickup1][hushed] Glenn, stay here.
6)  LEE
[pickup1][hushed] Glenn, let's go. [running to a new station - quick and fast]
7)  CARLEY
[hushed] What do we do? Throw open the lid and start shooting? Yank whatever that is out and kill it?
8)  CARLEY
[catching your breath, but quiet, there are zombies around] Where is he?
339)  CARLEY
[catching your breath, but quiet, there are zombies around] Where is he?
9)  LEE
[hushed, tense] Sure did.
340)  LEE
[hushed, tense] Sure did.
10)  LEE
[catching your breath, but quiet, there are zombies around] I'm not sure... he would've called for help, right?
341)  LEE
[catching your breath, but quiet, there are zombies around] I'm not sure... he would've called for help, right?
11)  CARLEY
[keeping quiet, zombies around] What? If he was being attacked? I'd think so...
342)  CARLEY
[keeping quiet, zombies around] What? If he was being attacked? I'd think so...
12)  LEE
[quiet!] Shit! Get down!
343)  LEE
[quiet!] Shit! Get down!
13)  LEE
[hushed] Let me have a look!
14)  CARLEY
[hushed] Did you see that?
338)  CARLEY
[hushed] Did you see that?
15)  GLENN
[hushed] GUYS! Oh man, I'm glad you're here.
16)  GLENN
[hushed] We talked and, well, then she got scared. I was trying to get in to help her, and then she started yelling and saying I was bitten. I tried to convince her I wasn't and that's when all of our friends showed up. A couple almost got me and I ended up hiding in there.
17)  GLENN
[hushed] Anyway, I was going room to room and when I got to that one, up there on the corner, I heard crying on the other side of the door.
18)  CARLEY
[hushed] Can we get out of here before any of these things notice us?
347)  CARLEY
[hushed] Can we get out of here before any of these things notice us?
19)  GLENN
[hushed] I was out here looking for gas and, y'know I thought it might be a good idea to get some pillows and stuff for the group. Creature comforts, you know?
20)  GLENN
[hushed] Not yet. There's a survivor trapped up there.
349)  GLENN
[hushed] Not yet. There's a survivor trapped up there.
21)  CARLEY
[hushed] Lucky you; now let's go!
352)  CARLEY
[hushed] Lucky you; now let's go!
22)  GLENN
[hushed] We can't just leave her.
351)  GLENN
[hushed] We can't just leave her.
23)  CARLEY
[hushed] Why not?
24)  
Glen's right; we've got to help.
25)  LEE
Glenn's right, we've got to help.
26)  
You're right Carley; we need to go back.
27)  LEE
[hushed] You're right, Carley. Every second we spend out here, we're taking a chance.
28)  GLENN
[hushed] But she's just in there, alone.
29)  LEE
[hushed] It's not worth it, Glenn. She's safe, they can't get to her.
30)  CARLEY
[hushed] Let's go, guys.
31)  GLENN
[hushed] We're really going to do this? We're just going to leave her?
32)  
Yes; we have to go back.
33)  LEE
[Hushed] Yeah, Glenn. I'm sorry, we need to get back now that you're ok.
34)  GLENN
[hushed,angry] Fine.
35)  CARLEY
[hushed] It's for the best.
36)  GLENN
[hushed, angry] Let's just go.
37)  
Fine, you're right. Let's help.
38)  
We can look around for a minute.
39)  LEE
[hushed] We should at least look around for a minute.
40)  GLENN
[hushed] And if we just HAPPEN to rescue that girl, then good on us.
41)  LEE
[hushed] Yes, then good on us.
42)  CARLEY
[hushed] Ugh, fine. We can try to rescue the girl, but she better be a sweetheart. You all right with that, Lee?
43)  LEE
[hushed Yeah, I'm in.
44)  CARLEY
[hushed]Glenn! What are you doing in there?!
45)  LEE
[hushed] Carley was going to shoot you.
46)  GLENN
[hushed] Huh?! [carley was going to shoot you]
47)  LEE
[hushed] Her idea. [jokingly passng the blame]
48)  CARLEY
[hushed, surprised] Jesus, Glenn!
52)  CARLEY
[hushed, surprised] Jesus, Glenn!
49)  LEE
[hushed] We were about to rough you up.
50)  GLENN
[hushed] I'm glad you didn't.
51)  LEE
[hushed] Same.
53)  GLENN
[hushed] Hey, guys.
54)  LEE
[hushed] What's up.
55)  GLENN
[hushed] Just been hiding.
56)  CARLEY
[hushed] No shit? You scared the hell out of us.
57)  GLENN
[hushed] Ok, so she's trapped in that room up there. I say we get up there as quiet as possible, get her out, and then hustle back to my car.
58)  CARLEY
[hushed] If we're going to do this, we're doing it right.
59)  LEE
[hushed] Yeah we are. Minimal noise. From the looks of it we've got that walker over there, the one by the car, and the one by the stairs.
60)  CARLEY
[hushed] Plus the two in front of the door.
61)  GLENN
[hushed] The quieter, the better. When they got the jump on me, they all came out from that forest behind us. We don' t know how many are roaming around in there, looking for something to eat.
62)  CARLEY
[hushed] All right, Lee. We'll follow your lead.
63)  LEE
Hello in there? We're here to help.
64)  MOTEL GIRL
[upset, through door] Please, just go away!
65)  CARLEY
Let's go, guys.
66)  LEE
In a minute.
67)  LEE
[talking through a door] If you open up, we can take you somewhere safer. We've got a group in town.
68)  MOTEL GIRL
[upset, through door] No no no! Please no.
69)  GLENN
She's in trouble!
70)  LEE
[talking through door] Miss! We're coming in!
71)  LEE
You're hurt.
72)  CARLEY
Oh, God.
73)  MOTEL GIRL
I...I said stay away.
74)  GLENN
We need to get you help.
75)  MOTEL GIRL
It's too late for that.
76)  CARLEY
Guys, she's been bitten.
77)  GLENN
What?!
176)  GLENN
What?!
78)  MOTEL GIRL
I told you. I said go away, I'm bit. But you wouldn't just leave.
79)  LEE
Let's calm down. You could be fine.
80)  MOTEL GIRL
I won't be fine. My boyfriend was bitten. You get sick and you die and you come back and you kill anything you can find.
81)  GLENN
You have a boyfriend?
82)  CARLEY
[terse, under your breath] GLENN.
83)  MOTEL GIRL
I don't want that. It's not Christian. Please, just leave me, please go.
84)  MOTEL GIRL
You have a gun.
85)  CARLEY
[dubious] So?
86)  MOTEL GIRL
Can I borrow it?
87)  CARLEY
What do you mean "borrow"?
88)  MOTEL GIRL
Give it to me. I can just, you know, end this and then - then there's no problem.
89)  LEE
Whoa whoa whoa...
90)  MOTEL GIRL
PLEASE. I don't want to be one of them. They're...they're...satanic.
91)  MOTEL GIRL
Give it to me, PLEASE!
92)  GLENN
This is crazy!
93)  CARLEY
Please, step back.
94)  MOTEL GIRL
It's just two seconds, just one bullet, and I can be with my family, and it'll all be fine.
95)  LEE
Miss...
96)  CARLEY
Back up!
97)  MOTEL GIRL
PLEASE!
98)  MOTEL GIRL
[falling yell/scream]
99)  GLENN
[falling yell/scream]
100)  
Give it to her.
101)  LEE
Give it to her.
102)  CARLEY
What? You can't be serious.
103)  LEE
Do it.
104)  
You can't have a gun.
105)  LEE
We can't let you do that to yourself.
106)  MOTEL GIRL
Then do it for me!
107)  CARLEY
We need to get going.
108)  
Ok, we'll leave.
109)  LEE
Ok, we'll leave. Just try to take care of yourself, for whatever time you have left.
110)  
Come with us, we'll get help.
111)  LEE
Come with us and we'll find you some help.
112)  
What if you turn and come after us?
113)  LEE
What if you turn and follow us back to our group?
114)  MOTEL GIRL
I know! That was why I was locked away. I can't let this happen to me.
116)  LEE
Whoa, take it easy. We just want to help.
117)  MOTEL GIRL
You can't.
118)  GLENN
[puke]
119)  CARLEY
Let's get out of here.
120)  LEE
[running to stop a girl from killing herself] Nonono no, NO!
121)  GLENN
Get in!
122)  CARLEY
What are you doing?!
123)  GLENN
This thing's temperamental! The starter gets stuck and I need to give it some love. Do you have a hammer or anything like that?
124)  CARLEY
Carley looks dumbfounded and gets in the car.
125)  GLENN
Come on, this stupid thing!
126)  GLENN
It's almost fixed!
127)  LEE
There can't be many bullets left...[shooting a gun]
128)  GLENN
AH! It's stuck again!
129)  LEE
Come on, Glenn! There's way too many of them!
130)  GLENN
GOT IT!
131)  LEE
Here!
136)  LEE
Here!
132)  LEE
That's a little love?!
137)  LEE
That's a little love?!
133)  GLENN
It works!
138)  GLENN
It works!
134)  GLENN
Crap! Hold them off!
139)  GLENN
Crap! Hold them off!
135)  LEE
[mutters, panicked] Man...
140)  LEE
[mutters, panicked] Man...
141)  LEE
[hushed] Push on three! One, two...three!
262)  LEE
[hushed] Push on three! One, two...three!
283)  LEE
[hushed] Push on three! One, two...three!
142)  LEE
Yeah, until a crowd of them stumbles out of the forest. Let's get the axe and get out of here.
143)  GLENN
Look!
144)  GLENN
What...what do you think...?
145)  LEE
I don't know Glenn, we got to move.
146)  LEE
[hushed] Whatever it is, we can kill it quietly.
270)  LEE
[hushed] Whatever it is, we can kill it quietly.
147)  LEE
[hushed] I'll throw open the lid, you be ready to shoot.
273)  LEE
[hushed] I'll throw open the lid, you be ready to shoot.
148)  CARLEY
[hushed] That's going to be loud.
271)  CARLEY
[hushed] That's going to be loud.
149)  LEE
[hushed] Then we deal with it.
272)  LEE
[hushed] Then we deal with it.
150)  LEE
[hushed] We're yanking whatever it is out of there.
274)  LEE
[hushed] We're yanking whatever it is out of there.
151)  LEE
[Hushed] Let's just have a look, be ready to run.
275)  LEE
[Hushed] Let's just have a look, be ready to run.
152)  LEE
[hushed] One...two...
153)  LEE
[hushed] One...two...
154)  LEE
[hushed] One...two...
276)  LEE
[hushed] One...two...
277)  LEE
[hushed] One...two...
278)  LEE
[hushed] One...two...
155)  MOTEL GIRL
Stop, just stop. I'm coming out.
156)  GLENN
You might want to break through that board first.
157)  LEE
There's a pillow over there.
158)  GLENN
That's about as far as I got when it came to supply gathering.
159)  LEE
I might have an idea for it.
160)  CARLEY
[pickup1] Good luck smothering them to death...
161)  LEE
That's not really what I have in mind.
162)  GLENN
That could scramble a brain pretty good.
163)  LEE
That's exactly what I was thinking. [with a wink]
164)  GLENN
[under his breath] I hope you're never trapped and need someone's help...
165)  
Let's head back.
166)  LEE
Let's just head back.
173)  LEE
Let's just head back.
179)  LEE
Let's just head back.
167)  
I'm sorry, ok?
168)  LEE
I'm sorry, all right?
169)  GLENN
Whatever.
170)  
She's probably fine.
171)  LEE
She's probably fine.
172)  GLENN
Yeah I'm sure she just strolled out of the room up there, no problem.
174)  
Get over it, ok?
175)  LEE
Get over it, ok?
177)  LEE
I said get over it. You can't help everybody. We've got folks back at the drugstore who need us more than she did.
178)  GLENN
Screw you, man.
180)  LEE
This should make short work of the walkers upstairs. Plus it'll come in handy back on the street.
181)  LEE
Two more.
182)  GLENN
That should help. [with a wink]
183)  GLENN
[hushed, over-excited] That was sick!
184)  GLENN
Lee! Behind you!
185)  LEE
[a "i just got bitten on the neck" scream]
216)  LEE
[a "i just got bitten on the neck" scream]
186)  GLENN
Lee! Get him!
187)  GLENN
Nice!
188)  LEE
Thanks for having my back.
189)  GLENN
For sure!
190)  GLENN
Lee! They're closing in!
191)  GLENN
Lee! Ah! AHHH!!! AHHHHHHHH!
192)  LEE
Oh...
193)  GLENN
...Fuck.
194)  GLENN
That was awesome!
195)  LEE
Now let's take care of those two so they don't end up getting the jump on us.
554)  LEE
Now let's take care of those two so they don't end up getting the jump on us.
196)  GLENN
That could've gone better.
197)  LEE
We'll just have to kill him the old fashioned way, I guess.
198)  CARLEY
[pickup1] Hey, look, we don't know what's going on up there. I'm putting out one more vote for going back.
199)  GLENN
[Ugh] Let's just do this. Lee?
200)  
We're saving this girl.
201)  LEE
No, we're saving this girl. Carley, you can go back if you want to.
202)  CARLEY
[pickup1] Guilt me, why don't you.
203)  LEE
I'm just saying.
204)  CARLEY
[pickup1] Come on, let's go save Glenn's damsel in distress.
205)  
Yeah, let's just go back.
206)  LEE
Let's go back.
207)  GLENN
Really?!
208)  LEE
I don't feel good about this, either way. We need to get back to our people.
209)  GLENN
I can't...what? Really?... I'm not going.
210)  CARLEY
[pickup1] Then we're taking your car. Give Lee the walkie-talkie and you can deal with this on your own.
211)  GLENN
But...
212)  LEE
I'm sorry, Glenn. Let's go protect the people we know we can.
213)  GLENN
Rad.
553)  GLENN
Rad.
214)  LEE
Aww SHIT!
215)  CARLEY
[pickup1] Lee!! NO!!!
217)  LEE
We can do something with that car, I bet, if it weren't for that fella lurking near the front.
218)  LEE
He's not going anywhere.
219)  LEE
Get out your gun.
284)  LEE
Get out your gun.
289)  LEE
Get out your gun.
292)  LEE
Get out your gun.
220)  CARLEY
[pickup1] But the noise...
286)  CARLEY
[pickup1] But the noise...
288)  CARLEY
[pickup1] But the noise...
290)  CARLEY
[pickup1] But the noise...
221)  LEE
Just follow my lead; stay right behind me.
285)  LEE
Just follow my lead; stay right behind me.
287)  LEE
Just follow my lead; stay right behind me.
291)  LEE
Just follow my lead; stay right behind me.
222)  LEE
I'm going to bash this guy's brains in.
241)  LEE
I'm going to bash this guy's brains in.
223)  GLENN
That might attract some attention.
242)  GLENN
That might attract some attention.
224)  CARLEY
[pickup1] [dubious] Yeah...
243)  CARLEY
[pickup1] [dubious] Yeah...
225)  LEE
Screw it, I'm doing this.
244)  LEE
Screw it, I'm doing this.
226)  LEE
If we time it right, we should be able to take them both out quietly. Glenn, you just keep the other one back.
227)  LEE
This pick is the prime walker killer. I should be able to take those guys out when they come around the corner of the RV.
228)  GLENN
I can watch your back, but it'd be nice if I wasn't empty handed.
229)  LEE
Ok, there are two roaming around the RV. We can probably hide over there for a second or two if we time it right.
230)  LEE
I'm not sure I can take them both out myself, even if I had a weapon.
231)  LEE
Well, I've got one pillow and two corpses.
232)  GLENN
An age old problem.
233)  LEE
We're probably going to have to handle him the old fashioned way.
234)  LEE
He's just roaming around over there.
235)  GLENN
He keeps going back and forth.
236)  GLENN
Dude, where'd your weapon go?
295)  GLENN
Dude, where'd your weapon go?
237)  LEE
[observational] Into that ice-pick sized hole.
294)  LEE
[observational] Into that ice-pick sized hole.
238)  GLENN
Haha, holy shit.
297)  GLENN
Haha, holy shit.
239)  CARLEY
[pickup1] Are you two done?
296)  CARLEY
[pickup1] Are you two done?
240)  GLENN
It's cool, now we've got THIS.
293)  GLENN
It's cool, now we've got THIS.
245)  LEE
They really want to get into that room.
246)  LEE
They don't even see us.
247)  CARLEY
[pickup1] Thank effing GOD.
248)  LEE
I think I found a pretty damn good way to stop these guys quietly.
249)  GLENN
Now we just have to get it quietly.
250)  LEE
Ow!
251)  GLENN
Hey man, that drew some attention. Be careful.
252)  LEE
I'm done trying to punch out windows.
253)  GLENN
They didn't hear a thing!
254)  LEE
One more of those ought to do it.
255)  GLENN
Whoa, dude! That was loud. And those guys heard it.
256)  LEE
Shit. I'll try to not do that again.
257)  GLENN
LEE! Seriously, man! They're getting wise!
258)  GLENN
DUDE! No more noise, man, we're fucked... you gotta...
259)  GLENN
What are you going to do with that?
260)  LEE
I don't really know. Do you have any tricks for getting into cars?
261)  GLENN
Not without tools or making a bunch of noise. And none with pillows.
263)  
Pillow
398)  
Pillow
264)  
Brick
265)  GLENN
[pickup1] And here, check this out.
266)  GLENN
[pickup1] Batteries or something could be useful.
267)  LEE
[pickup1] How is that supposed to help?...
268)  GLENN
[pickup1] And here!
269)  GLENN
[pickup1] I found it and thought the batteries or something could prove useful.
279)  LEE
[pickup1] I'll wait for him to get closer...
280)  LEE
[pickup1] Wait for it...
281)  GLENN
[pickup1] Bad idea, dude. Let's get out of here.
282)  GLENN
[pickup1] Bad idea. We can do better than that thing.
298)  GLENN
[pickup1]No!
299)  GLENN
[pickup1] What are you doing?! NO!
300)  LEE
[pickup1] GLENN.
301)  LEE
[pickup1][stern, holding a guy back] Leave her alone, Glenn.
302)  GLENN
[pickup1]NO! Come on!!!
303)  LEE
[pickup1]...you  need to think this through...
304)  LEE
[pickup1][ramping up intensity]...we'll find you a doctor, it'll be ok, let's all just...
305)  LEE
[pickup1]  Miss, just relax now...
306)  LEE
[pickup1] [sarcastic] It was her idea.
307)  LEE
[hushed][pickup1]Get your gun ready.
308)  LEE
[pickup1][hushed]Be ready to shoot.
337)  LEE
[pickup1][hushed]Be ready to shoot.
309)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed][SUPER relieved] GUYS! Oh man, I'm glad you're here.
310)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed]LISTEN. I was out here looking for gas. [continual sentence]
311)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] And then, up there in the corner room, I heard crying coming from inside.
312)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] It's a girl. We talked and she got frightened. I was trying to get in and help her and she started yelling and saying I was bitten.
313)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed]I tried to convince her I wasn't and that's when all of these guys came out of the forest. A couple almost got me and I ended up hiding in the ice machine.
314)  
Push
315)  LEE
[pickup1] Why don't you guys lag behind; just in case this goes to hell.
316)  CARLEY
[pickup1] Ok. We'll be right behind you.
317)  LEE
[pickup1][seen by zombie] Shit!
318)  LEE
[pickup1][seen by zombie] Shit! That guy saw me.
319)  LEE
[pickup1][seen by zombie] Dammit!
320)  LEE
[pickup1][seen by zombie] Fuck! I think he saw me!
321)  LEE
[pickup2][whispering]Looks like that guy was doing some uh, cranking.
322)  GLENN
[pickup2]You mean wrenching. You should hold onto that, could come in handy.
323)  LEE
[pickup2][quiet]Looks like that guy was doing some uh, cranking.
324)  GLENN
[pickup2][quiet] Sparkplug. [emph plug]You should hold onto that, could come in handy.
325)  GLENN
[pickup2][hushed]The porcelain inside these things turns car windows to tissue paper.
332)  GLENN
[pickup2][hushed]The porcelain inside these things turns car windows to tissue paper.
326)  GLENN
[pickup2][hushed]You picked up that sparkplug to shatter that window, right?
327)  GLENN
[pickup2][hushed]All right dude, let's see those ninja rocks.
328)  LEE
[pickup2][hushed]What the hell are you talking about?
329)  GLENN
[pickup2][hushed]Let me see the sparkplug.
333)  GLENN
[pickup2][hushed]Let me see the sparkplug.
330)  LEE
[pickup2][hushed]Ninja what now?
331)  GLENN
Wait-
334)  LEE
[pickup2][hushed] There's a pick in the truck.
335)  LEE
[pickup2][hushed] I wonder if there's anything in the pickup.
336)  LEE
[pickup2][hushed] It's locked.
344)  LEE
[pickup2] [phew]...
345)  CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] Jesus, Glenn!
346)  LEE
[pickup2][hushed] All right, that wasn't so hard. [to find your friend]
348)  LEE
[pickup2][hushed] Who is it?
350)  CARLEY
[pickup1] No way, we gotta go. NOW.
353)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] I'm saving her, with or without you.
354)  LEE
[pickup2][hushed] Damn right we can't.
355)  LEE
[pickup2][hushed] Think about if it was you.
356)  CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] You guys are suicidal. Over a girl!
357)  CARLEY
[pickup1] [hushed] Fine. Let's go save Glenn's damsel in distress.
358)  LEE
[pickup2][hushed] QUIETLY. Noise attracts these things. Now let's have a look around.
359)  LEE
[pickup2][hushed] Ok, this is the plan. We don't know how hard it's going to be to get her out of that room.
360)  LEE
[pickup2][hushed] So we have to kill every one of them in here.
361)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] Yeah, it's boarded up.
362)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] Oh man. She's eating something. So we got that one right there, close.
363)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] There's one back there, trying to get into a room, but I didn't see anyone actually in there.
364)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] The girl's behind that door -- those two seem to be on the scent.
365)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] I saw one lurking on the other side of that car.
366)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed]That's everything I know, man. But, you know, watch out.
367)  LEE
[pickup2][hushed] Let's head back to that wall. Safe there.
368)  LEE
[pickup2][hushed] We can hide by that RV if we're quiet and keep our heads down.
369)  LEE
[pickup2][hushed] There's a car up on ramps.
370)  LEE
[pickup2][hushed] We can hide by that pickup.
371)  LEE
[pickup2][hushed] We can head over there but we'll have to take care of that guy first.
372)  LEE
[pickup2][hushed] We can head over there but we'll have to take care of that guy first.
373)  LEE
[pickup2][hushed]We can go over there when the rest of these down here are taken care of.
374)  LEE
[pickup2] [hushed] We're doing this. No question.
375)  LEE
[pickup2][hushed] Take this. It's not much, but better for you to be armed with something.
376)  LEE
[pickup2][hushed] Maybe Doug's got a use for this.

[pickup1] [hushed] Be careful peeking around. If they get on our scent, we're toast.
412)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] Take a peek over the wall.
413)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] We can probably make it over to the RV or down to the truck if we're quick and quiet about it.
414)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] If we're going to kill all these guys we're going to have to sneak around.
415)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] I wouldn't say no to something I could use for protection.
416)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] She's still trapped up there. Let's get these guys down here taken care of!
417)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] We should keep looking around for weapons.
418)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] The longer you're unarmed the more nervous I get.
419)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] Let's go check out that truck under the awning.
420)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] Now let's clear out the area around the RV.
436)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] Now let's clear out the area around the RV.
421)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] We're a little naked out here, except for Carley's gun and we can't use that much.
422)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] We're going to need weapons.
423)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] You've got that pick, but I could really use something.
424)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] [man,]I hope that girl's ok...
426)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] [man,]I hope that girl's ok...
425)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] I think you're going to need more than your fists, man.
427)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] Let's keep looking around.
428)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] She's right above us, guys.
429)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] Let's start taking these guys out.
430)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] I'm worried about the girl upstairs.
431)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] Their groaning attracts the others.
432)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] Carley, you don't have a silencer for your sidearm, huh?
433)  CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] Those are illegal, Glenn.
434)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] Just a thought.
435)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] That one sitting down is just as dangerous as the others.
437)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] You have to be careful with your ride up on ramps like this.
438)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] Safety first, I guess.
439)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] We can get that guy by the wall over there, I bet...
440)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] Kill him, Lee -- before he attracts the others!
441)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] You need another weapon, man.
442)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] Be careful dealing with the two upstairs.
443)  CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] What do you see up there?
444)  CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] If I have to use this,[her gun] we're in trouble.
445)  CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] Where to next?
446)  CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] I'll cover you if you sneak over to the RV.
447)  CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] This is suicide...
448)  CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] We need to kill these things as quickly as possible...
449)  CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] There's a truck over there. Maybe we can find you a weapon.
450)  CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] Want to head over to the right?
451)  CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] Let's get the ones over there, head upstairs, and get out of here.
460)  CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] Let's get the ones over there, head upstairs, and get out of here.
464)  CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] Let's get the ones over there, head upstairs, and get out of here.
452)  CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] Let's keep moving.
453)  CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] You need to find a weapon.
454)  CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] Be careful getting up close to these guys; I can't always cover you.
455)  CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] Ready to move?
456)  CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] How are you going to kill that one by the car without attracting the others?
457)  CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] Trying to shoot that guy from here is probably a bad idea, huh?
458)  CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] I love this gun, but it sure isn't quiet.
459)  CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] Find a way to kill that guy before he alerts the others, ok?
461)  CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] I don't like being out in the open like this.
462)  CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] I'd prefer cover that can't just roll away.
465)  CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] I'd prefer cover that can't just roll away.
463)  CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed]
466)  CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] Quick! Before he attracts more!
467)  CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] Uh, Lee, weapon?
468)  CARLEY
[pickup1][hushed] We'll try to have your back, but this gun's a liability.
469)  GLENN
[pickup1][hushed] The moment we head towards that car, he's going to unleash enough noise to totally screw us.

[pickup1] NO.
476)  
Do it!
477)  
Then shoot her.
478)  
We can't take the risk of her alive.
479)  
Look at her. Please give it to her.
480)  LEE
[pickup3][angry,big] DO IT.
481)  CARLEY
[pickup1] FINE. You're all fucking crazy.
482)  LEE
[pickup3] Look at her, Carley. There's no happy ending to this.
483)  MOTEL GIRL

484)  LEE
[pickup3] She could turn right now. We can't take a risk. Hand it over to her.
485)  CARLEY
[pickup1] [relenting] God, just...ok. Fine.
486)  CARLEY
[pickup1] You're insane! Just take this thing.
487)  CARLEY
[pickup1] HUH?!
488)  LEE
[pickup3] SHOOT HER. Help her out, here.
489)  LEE
[pickup3] Then shoot her.
490)  CARLEY
[pickup1] [relenting, sad] Ok, fine.
491)  LEE
[pickup3] Because somebody needs to pick up the gun. We can't leave it. You two go on.
528)  LEE
[pickup3] Because somebody needs to pick up the gun. We can't leave it. You two go on.

494)  MOTEL GIRL
[pickup1] Thank you so much. I know how terrible this must be.
527)  MOTEL GIRL
[pickup1] Thank you so much. I know how terrible this must be.
495)  GLENN
[pickup3] [emotoinal]We can't watch this, let's go.

534)  GLENN
[pickup3] [emotional]What?! Why not?
499)  LEE
[pickup3] Here you go.
529)  LEE
[pickup3] Here you go.
501)  
I'm here with you.
502)

510)  CARLEY
[pickup1] Look, I'll just walk over there and blow him away, and hope it's not too loud.
511)  LEE
[pickup3] Ha, yeah right. I'll try to find some way to muffle your shot.
512)  LEE
[pickup3] Oh shit! That thing got a look at me.
513)  LEE
[pickup3] Shit, I think it saw me.
514)  LEE
[pickup3] Oh man, it might've seen me.
515)  LEE
